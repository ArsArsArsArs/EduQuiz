  <p>Did you use Duolingo? And Anki? I used them both, and I thought, it would be fascinating to combine the Duolingo playful style and the ability to create own cards from Anki.<br/>That's how I created EduQuiz. It allows you to create libraries or import them from an external source. The libraries support cards of different types, which you can create, then pass. The app also has a streak counter.</p>
  <h3>Supported languages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Russian</li>
    <li><i>I guess Swedish will be here one day...</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Powered by Go and Fyne.io</h2>
  <p>Go is not a native Android language. <a href="https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne">Fyne</a>, a cross-platform GUI library, was made by enthusiasts. That being said, consider that the app may look kind of odd, and the interface may be laggy sometimes. There's nothing I myself can do about that.<br/><i>Still, Golang and Fyne.io are great, and I appreciate the developers of both!</i></p>

  <h2>Future plans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Smart Start: the app will mostly give the cards you fail on</li>
    <li>More detailed stats</li>
  </ul>
